	 * Refactoring classes - done;
	 * Refactoring interfaces - done;
	 * Refactoring methods - done;
	 * Refactoring properties - done;
	 * Refactoring fields - done;

	* Don't repeat yourself - done;

## 4. Implement unit tests:

	* The code coverage of the unit tests should be at least 90% - nope
	
	* At least 10 of your tests should use mocking (Moq, JustMock or other) - nope
